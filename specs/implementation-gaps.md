> **Scope:** All 30+ routes, CSS inspection, console errors, HTTP status, component structure

## 1. Functional Bugs

### 1.1 `teacher_class_subjects` Table Missing — 500 Error 🔴

**Route:** `/academic/assignments`
**Console error:**
```
Error: Failed query: select `teacher_class_subjects`.`id`, ...
from `teacher_class_subjects`
Table 'sistren.teacher_class_subjects' doesn't exist
```

**Impact:** Full 500 error page. Blocks the entire "Tugas Guru" feature — cannot assign teachers to classes/subjects.

**Files involved:**
| File | Status |
|------|--------|
| `src/lib/db/schema/teacherClassSubject.ts` | Schema exists ✓ |
| `src/actions/academic.ts` | Uses `getAssignments()` that queries it ✓ |
| `src/app/(app)/academic/assignments/page.tsx` | Crashes fetching data ✗ |
| Migration | Not executed or never generated ✗ |

**Known constraint:** From MEMORY.md — `teacher_class_subjects` unique constraint auto-generated name exceeds 64-char MariaDB limit. Fix was `unique('tcs_unique').on(...)`. Migration may need to be re-generated.

## 2. Layout & Component Issues

### 2.1 ToastProvider Double-Wrapped 🟡

`ToastProvider` is instantiated in two places:

- **`src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`** — outer wrapper around `AppLayoutClient`
- **`src/features/layout/AppLayoutClient.tsx`** — wraps `{children}` again

Nested provider instances. One should be removed.

---

## 3. Route & Navigation Issues

### 3.1 `/attendance` Route Missing 🟡

Sidebar has a "Presensi" menu item pointing to `/attendance` (visible to roleLevel >= 40), but no route file exists at `src/app/(app)/attendance/`.

Navigation to this URL shows a 404 client-side.

### 3.2 `/admin` Has No Landing Content 🟢

`src/app/(app)/admin/page.tsx`:
```tsx
await verifyRoleLevel(80);
redirect('/admin/users');
```
Immediately redirects. No admin landing page or dashboard. Consider removing the route or adding content.

### 3.3 `/permissions` Immediately Redirects 🟢

`src/app/(app)/permissions/page.tsx`:
```tsx
await verifyRoleLevel(100);
redirect('/admin/users');
```
Same pattern — redirect with no content. This route is reachable via the sidebar (level 100 only) but shows no UI.

### 3.4 `/alumni/transcript` Redirects Superadmin 🟢

Intentional by design (`maxLevel: 40`), but worth noting: superadmin cannot access the alumni transcript page.

---

## 4. Dark Mode

### 4.1 No Dark Mode Toggle 🟡

Dark mode CSS variables are defined in `global.css` under `.dark`, and `next-themes` ThemeProvider is configured with `defaultTheme="system"`. However, there's no UI toggle (button/switch) in the sidebar or header to switch between light/dark modes. Users relying on system preference get dark mode automatically, but cannot manually switch.

---

## 5. Minor Issues

### 5.1 Missing favicon.ico 🟢

`GET /favicon.ico` returns 404. Minor — visible in browser console/network tab.

---

## 6. Data & Edge Cases

| Observation | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Dashboard shows 1 student, 1 teacher, 0 enrollments, 0 announcements | Expected — fresh demo seed data |
| Finance page accessible only to level ≥ 80 | Intentional (admin/TU only) |
| Students page shows "Dokumen" column with no data | Expected — documents not uploaded yet |
| Quick Login buttons on login page work correctly | Verified — all 4 roles login successfully |
| Register (PPDB) page exists at `/register` | Functional for new student registration |

---

## 7. Priority Recommendations

| Priority | Item | Effort | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| **P0** | Run migration to create `teacher_class_subjects` table | Low | Unblocks assignments page |
| **P1** | Fix ToastProvider double-wrap | Low | Code cleanliness |
| **P1** | Add dark mode toggle UI | Medium | UX completeness |
| **P2** | Create `/attendance` page or remove sidebar link | Medium | Navigation accuracy |
| **P2** | Add favicon | Low | Browser UX |
| **P3** | Add content to `/admin` landing page | Low | Content completeness |
| **P3** | `/permissions` — add content or remove route | Low | Dead route cleanup |
